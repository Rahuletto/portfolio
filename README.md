### Hello! I am 
# Rahul Marban

I am Rahul Marban, currently pursuing  CSE with AIML at SRMIST. While I am passionate about AI, my true love
lies in  designing interfaces that combine aesthetic appeal with  strong user experiences.
Taught myself to  build everything from the visible parts of websites to the behind-the-scenes  magic, making tech accessible and user-friendly
