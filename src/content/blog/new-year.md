New year, New me ✨. 

As we step into the new year, I'm thrilled to share a major update with each one of you. Change is in the air, and I am gearing up for a bold transformation! 🚀

## Whats new?
Embracing a fresh, dynamic design that reflects a space-like theme which resembles that knowledge is like the space, infinite and constantly expanding. The makeover isn't just cosmetic; It's a brand-new start for me, focusing heavily on UI/UX instead of back-end side.

Thank you for being a valued part of my network. Here's to a year filled with fresh perspectives, exciting connections, and a brand-new look!

I wish you all a very happy new year 🎇🧨 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣4️⃣
