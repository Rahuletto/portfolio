In the world of user interface (UI) design, one concept stands out as a necessary foundation for success: **Accessibility**. Building welcoming interfaces that adapt towards users with varying needs is not just a responsibility, expand your audience, and ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

## Understanding the Importance of Accessibility

One of the most important reasons to prioritize accessibility is to ensure equal access to information and services for all users. Accessibility benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities.

## Tips for Accessible designs

### Semantic HTML

Use semantic HTML to give your content a meaningful structure. Screen readers rely on HTML tags to convey information to users, so using the right tags (e.g., `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<button>`) improves the accessibility of your user interface.

### Descriptive Content

Make sure your content is descriptive and concise. Use clear and straightforward language, and include alternative text for images. This not only benefits users with screen readers, but also those in low-bandwidth situations.

```html
<img src="/blogs/accessibility.webp" alt="accessibility in ui design" />
```

### Color Contrast and Font Readability

Pay attention to color contrast to ensure that the text is readable. Consider users with visual impairments and create sufficient contrast. Choose readable and adaptable fonts that allow users to adjust the size of the text to their specific needs.

> [Chrome Devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/contrast) provides alot of tools to check the color contrast between the text and its background.

Low contrast text is the top accessibility issue on the web. In February 2022, 83.9% of the top million home pages had this issue. Check out the [WebAIM Million 2022 report](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag) to learn more.

### Keyboard Navigation

Ensure that all interactive elements can be navigated using a keyboard. Some users rely on keyboard navigation due to motor impairments or other conditions. Test and optimize navigation without depending entirely on mouse interactions.

> `Tab` is commonly used to navigate

### Responsive Design

Design your user interface to be responsive to different screen sizes and devices. This not only benefits users of varying abilities, but it also contributes to a more positive overall user experience.

Stats shows that `>50%` of users come from Mobile!
